# RestoRun
RestoRun is a comprehensive Restaurant Management System developed as my final year project in the BSc Computer Science program. This system is designed to enhance operational efficiency and customer satisfaction in the restaurant industry through the integration of modern technology.

The main features are:


QR-Coded Menu: Customers can access the menu by scanning a QR code, providing a contactless and hygienic dining experience.

Real-Time Order Tracking: Orders placed by customers are instantly communicated to all relevant staff. The kitchen prepares the order while the waitstaff can track its status in real-time.

Inventory Management: The system monitors ingredient stock levels, automatically updating the menu to prevent customers from ordering items that are out of stock.

Sales Reports: The system generates daily, weekly, and monthly revenue reports, assisting management in monitoring financial performance and identifying trends.

Customer Feedback: Post-meal surveys allow customers to provide feedback, helping the restaurant continuously improve its services.

Table Management: The system tracks table occupancy and order status, ensuring efficient use of restaurant space.

The main objectives of RestoRun are to:


Facilitate seamless communication between the kitchen and waitstaff.
Enhance the customer experience with an up-to-date, easily accessible menu.
Provide detailed sales and inventory reports to aid in decision-making.
Incorporate customer feedback into restaurant operations for continuous improvement.
